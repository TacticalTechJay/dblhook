# DBLHook

Ditch KSoft.Si and use your own self hosted webhook!

Using this is fairly, all you need is node, npm, a db that works with TypeORM, and most importantly, a discord bot listed on DBL.

## Setup & Run

1. Run `npm install`
2. Have an actual database running and used by your own bot.
3. Edit config.example.json in a way that fits and rename it to config.json.
4. Run `node index.js`
